                    Hi there I am Daniel, I am a passionate, driven, and adaptable learner who
                    strives to create products that help bridge the gap between people and technology. 
                    I specialize in working with SaaS companies and 
                    in my free time I love visiting the symphony, playing soccer, practicing Taekwondo or learning more about ethics.
